This was the final project for Math 499: Linear Algebra for Data Science during Fall 2020 at UTK. Check out the project report for a more detailed explanation of each problem and my solutions.

You will need https://github.com/arvkevi/kneed to run the parts of the code for problem 1 and 4 since I use it to get the elbow point.
For problem 6, you will need tensorflow 2.3 to run the jupyter notebook.
